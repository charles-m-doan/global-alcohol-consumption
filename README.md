# Global Alcohol Consumption

An analysis of alcohol consumption across countries using R and statistical estimation techniques. This was a group project for STAT 3202 at The Ohio State University during the Spring Semester of 2019 assigned by professor David Dalpiaz.

The original project description by the instructor can be seen <a href="https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat3202-sp19/project/proj-01/proj-01.html">here</a> with the page for our specific data set shown <a href="https://daviddalpiaz.github.io/stat3202-sp19/project/proj-01/proj-01-L.html">here</a>.

### Notes

All of the code that generated the report tables and plots was written by myself, and I also wrote portions of the report analysis. This was my first real attempt at a markdown project, so it will probably be apparent looking at the code that I was still thinking like a Java programmer. I don't regard the R-code in this project as elegant or praiseworthy, I merely display it to show that I have familiarity working with R code and statistical concepts in general. The instructor provided feedback on the coding style which I took to heart, and I believe my code for the <a href="https://github.com/charles-m-doan/airline-on-time-performance">2nd project</a> was a major improvement.
